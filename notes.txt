HELP

-p --package    Full package from GOPATH to the struct.
                Your can use main if the struct is in the main program you are working on.
                This requires you to use -f

-s --struct     The Name of the struct you want to generate data for. This is case sensitive

-c --Count      The number of structs in a slice you want generated.
                It will always generate a slice even if count is 1

-f --file       The file where the struct is located. If -p is anything other than "main" this will be ignored
